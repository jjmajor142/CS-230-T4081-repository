A repository for the Operating Platforms class


The Gaming Room is a game development company that wants to create the game Draw It or Lose It and have it be a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. 

My strongest part of the development document was the recomendation section. Once a product framework is selected I am able to explore that framework 
and make sure that it has all of the requirements that are needed for the program.

I would redo the design constraints because I didn't clearly understand what the question was asking.

It is important to consider the user's needs because your software needs to be able to meet the demands they put on the system. I interpreted the user's needs based off
of the software requirements documentation.

The approach I used was to read the program requirements and create an outline of the program using psudo code and flow charts. In the future I will utilize more UML diagrams into the process.
